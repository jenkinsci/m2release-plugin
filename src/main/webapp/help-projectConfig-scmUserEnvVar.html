    If defined, an environment variable with this name will hold the scm username when triggering a release build (this is the username the user enters when triggering a release build, not the username given to Jenkins' SCM configuration of the job).<br />
    As the passed passwords would potentially get written to the logs and therefore visible to users, we recommend you to install the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Mask+Passwords+Plugin">Mask Password Plugin</a>.
