<div>
	An environment variable with this name indicates whether the current build is a release build or not. This can be used e.g. within a shell or the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Conditional+BuildStep+Plugin">conditional buildstep</a> to do pre and post release processing.
	The value will be boolean (<code>true</code> if it is a release build, <code>false</code> if its not a release build).
